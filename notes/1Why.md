# Why Webpack

## Origins of JS in the web
Only 2 ways to LOAD js in the browser...
- script tag w. src attr && refering a js file
- script tag with js IN html

### Issues with those 2 ways
- doesn't scale
- too many scripts
- each browser has limit of concurrent requests
- one script becomes too large
- scope
- file-size
- readability
- fragility
- monolith files
